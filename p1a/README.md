### P1a

#### my-sed.c
Opened the file the user gave me, use fgets() to get each line of the file and print it to the console.

#### my-cat.c
Open each file specified by user with a loop until there are no more arguments. If no file is given I use stdin instead. I search each line for the word using strstr() then use a function I created to replace the word in the line.

#### my-uniq.c
Open each file specified by user with a loop until there are no more arguments. If no file is given I use stdin instead. I keep track of two lines and compare them, if they are the same dont print, otherwise print the line.
