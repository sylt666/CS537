my-cat

- implemented a program that reads a file as specified by the user and prints its contents

my-grep

- implemented a variant of the UNIX tool grep. This tool looks through a file, line by line, trying to find a user-specified search term in the line. If a line has the word within it, the line is printed out, otherwise it is not.

my-zip

- implemented a file compression tool. For example, the program would read a file with the following contents: aaaaaaaaaabbbb, then it would turn it into 10a4b

my-unzip

- implemented a file decompression tool
- undoes what my-zip did
