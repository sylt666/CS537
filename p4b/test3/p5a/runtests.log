test mismatch FAILED
 (Run on a filesystem with .. pointing to the wrong directory)
 ./xcheck returned incorrect status code. Expected 1 got 0

 Test it yourself by running
 xcheck /u/c/s/cs537-1/ta/tests/5a-new/images/mismatch
 and check out the test folder
 /u/c/s/cs537-1/ta/tests/5a-new/err/mismatch
 to compare your error output with reference outputs. 

test loop FAILED
 (Run on a filesystem with a loop in the directory tree)
 ./xcheck returned incorrect status code. Expected 1 got 0

 Test it yourself by running
 xcheck /u/c/s/cs537-1/ta/tests/5a-new/images/loop
 and check out the test folder
 /u/c/s/cs537-1/ta/tests/5a-new/err/loop
 to compare your error output with reference outputs. 

test repair FAILED
 (Repair a filesystem with lost inodes, check if every lost inode is found)
 image is not correctly repaired.
